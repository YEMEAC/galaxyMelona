This project was developed during the Interaction and Interface Design class' period. This is a simplified implementation for Android of the classic game Space Invader. Eclipse was the IDE chosen to develop the application so it can be easy imported into it. The project also has the .apk file to install the application in any Android device. The current version of the application is made to work with a screen of 400x600.
